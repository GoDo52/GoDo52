- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @GoDo52 - Biotechnology student from Ukraine. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in: Data Structures, Databases, OOP, and I guess programming and it's math in general)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, and then planning to move onto C++ or C language.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me @Xeon_noeX - Telegram, or txrushclash@gmail.com

I'm creating GitHub for tracking my progress as I move through immense world of programming. 
Maybe you will find something interesting for yourself there in future. 
Also, I kinda want this page to be my portfolio, as I want to work in this sphere in the future.
